  about:
    "ByteBot is a game designed to teach children basic sequential logic. The player uses a modular block system to navigate a dog-themed car through a map while collecting rewards and avoiding obstacles.\n\n The project stemmed from the teamâ€™s interest in creating something that introduced basic programming concepts to kids not through screens, but through tangible interaction. The idea was to create a low-pressure way for kids to explore coding logic like sequencing and modularity, while also getting immediate feedback through physical movement.",
